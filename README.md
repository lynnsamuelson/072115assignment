An assignment from Nashville Software School to practice using functions and math related to functions.  The instructions are:

    - In JavaScript, have a function divides a number by 10
    - In JavaScript, have a function that multiplies a number by 5
    - When the button is clicked, call a JavaScript function that checks if the user has entered in a value in the      input field
    - If there is no value, put an appropriate message in an alert box telling the user to enter something
    - If there is a value, and its numeric value is greater than 10000, call a function that passes in the user          -entered value as an argument, and the name of the function that divides by 10.
    - If there is a value, and its numeric value is less than 10000, call a function that passes in the user-entered     value as an argument, and the name of the function that multiplies by 5. Write the result of the calculation into     the HTML document. (edited)
